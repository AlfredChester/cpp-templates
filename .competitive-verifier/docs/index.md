This cp library is powered by [competitive-verifier/competitive-verifier](https://github.com/competitive-verifier/competitive-verifier). Thanks for making this project possible.

The library is mainly for OI competitions, as well as some online cp contests on codeforces or atcoder. It is devoted to the highest efficiency and the widest compatibility. Any issue can be reported on the github issue page, but no bugfixes are guaranteed to be made.

Jiangly's library and watashi's library are from [this link for jiangly](https://github.com/hh2048/XCPC/) and [this link for watashi](https://github.com/nju-icpc/code-library-legacy/). My library is open source under the MIT License.
